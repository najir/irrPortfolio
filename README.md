#Description
My personal website source code.   
ASP.NET CORE for the backend elements and API access. React.js as my front-end UI.      
This personal website will be used to host a variety of data for storage and viewing.   
I will also be using this website as a testing ground for more complex features I may use in other   
projects. An overview of features I look to include;   
- Multi-Page application to access documents quickly   
- A Login system with a simple admin page   
- Portfolio page with pictures, gifs, and other visual feedback elements   
- Simple home and about-me pages   
- A viewable and saveable, easy to access copy of my resume  
- A visual time-line overview of my life and past/current/upcoming projects   
- Blog page with comments, login security, rss feed, infinite scroll loading etc...   

I also intend to have a significant portion of my data and elements be stored, accessed, and 
adjusted on the client side. Keeping server interactions and calls to an absolute minimum.   

Specific details will be written here as the project progresses:
