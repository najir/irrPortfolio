#Description
My personal website source code written in C# and JS.   
ASP.NET CORE for the backend elements and API access. React.js as my front-end UI.      
This personal website will be used to host a variety of data for storage and viewing.   
I will also be using this website as a testing ground for more complex features I may use in other   
projects. An overview of features I look to include;   
- Multi-Page application to access documents quickly   
- A Login system with a simple admin page   
- Portfolio page with pictures, gifs, and other visual feedback elements   
- Simple home and about-me pages   
- A viewable and saveable, easy to access copy of my resume  
- A visual time-line overview of my life and past/current/upcoming projects   
- Blog page with comments, login security, rss feed, infinite scroll loading etc...   
   

Specific details will be written here as the project progresses:
